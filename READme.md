# Additional Bootstrap Components #

## Cards ##
I used cards within the second set of columns
 in the css grid. This allowed me to add interactive
  button elements, as well as to group information 
  in an aesthetic way.

## Button ##
I used a button to link to my art instagram,
 styling the button within the theme of the page. 
 I also used the flexbox components of the container
  itself to push the button to the center of the 
  container.
